      <description>Frozen Particle Waves Frozen Particle Waves is a project I started to learn and demonstrate the use of a Spring Boot server app with an Angular client side UI. Currently it can be used to aggregate images from webcams that expose images through http endpoints and also supports basic auth. It uses Spring Boot as the application server to provide REST endpoints to the client side Angular UI. Spring security is used to secure the endpoints and handle user authn/authz.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a bargain hunter. Lately I have been playing with some low powered windows cloudbooks. I picked it up &amp;ldquo;refurbished&amp;rdquo;, the box and packaging looked new, for less than $200. It has a full HD 14&amp;rdquo; screen which I was searching for as the similar size 720p model I had before was a little on the pixeley side for text. Also, it was repurposed as a computer for a student. As usual I made a backup image of the internal storage for when it gets passed on to the next person that wants windows.</description>
