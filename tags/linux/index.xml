      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a bargain hunter. Lately I have been playing with some low powered windows cloudbooks. I picked it up &amp;ldquo;refurbished&amp;rdquo;, the box and packaging looked new, for less than $200. It has a full HD 14&amp;rdquo; screen which I was searching for as the similar size 720p model I had before was a little on the pixeley side for text. Also, it was repurposed as a computer for a student. As usual I made a backup image of the internal storage for when it gets passed on to the next person that wants windows.</description>
