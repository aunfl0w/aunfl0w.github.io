      <title>Alter system calls with LD_PRELOAD</title>

      <description>Use LD_PRELOAD to alter library calls I have a program that is failing because it is making a system call to change permissins on a file with chmod, fchmodat, and fchmod -S 2. The program does not own the file, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to change the permission but fails with -1 EPERM on this call. This was determined with strace -f -e chmod,fchmod,fchmodat $program
Example program This program simulates the behaviour of the application with the issue.</description>

      <description>How to mount a block device image Task: An image of a block divice has been created with dd for data recovery purposes. Mount the filesystem from the image and access files.
Review image partition information Confirm that the image size matches the size of the source block device. If the size is incorrect review the block device options or try another program such as ddrescue to read a failing block device.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a bargain hunter. Lately I have been playing with some low powered windows cloudbooks. I picked one up &amp;ldquo;refurbished&amp;rdquo;, the box and packaging looked new, for less than $200. It has a full HD 14&amp;quot; screen which I was searching for as the similar size 720p model I had before was a little on the pixeley side for text. Also, it was repurposed as a computer for a student. As usual, I made a backup image of the internal storage in case the next next person wants windows.</description>
