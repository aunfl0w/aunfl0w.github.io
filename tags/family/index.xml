      <description>Not the view I was expecting It was a wonderful clear labor day on the river. The water was cool and flowing east just west of the Lake Wylie dam. A break from floating on a tube to climb a tree to a rope swing ends early with a fall. A gash to the calf and a splash in the water. In short time my daughter will be whisked away in an ambulance.</description>
