<h1 id="not-the-view-i-was-expecting">Not the view I was expecting</h1>
<p>It was a wonderful clear labor day on the river.  The water was cool and flowing east just west of the Lake Wylie dam.  A break from floating on a tube to climb a tree to a rope swing ends early with a fall.  A gash to the calf and a splash in the water.  In short time my daughter will be whisked away in an ambulance.</p>
<p>The stage was set for a battle to come.  Infection has spread quickly and tissue around the wound is necrosing.  A team of doctors flood the room and speak with words I don’t know.  Consent forms for many procedures are given to me.  I only ask will it help my daughter get better before I sign.</p>
<p>Three operations later the battle with infection has turned in our favor.  I sit watching her recover in the hospital bed.  Now with a gap of flesh that would take two hands to fill missing from her calf. This is not what I expected on my birthday weekend.  It has now been four days that seemed like four weeks.  In front of me I see four intravenous antibiotics and bags of fluids healing my eldest child.</p>

<p>Ahead lies a long recovery with skin grafts and medical equipment that is strange to me.  In time all should return to normal.  In the mean time life will be moments of normalcy punctuated with appointments and home nursing procedures.</p>
<p>Don’t take for granted the truly valuable things in your life.  You are here for just a short moment.  Keep those you love close to your reach and near in your mind.  And whatever you do don’t climb the tree to the rope swing!</p>
