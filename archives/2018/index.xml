      <description>Frozen Particle Waves Frozen Particle Waves is a project I started to learn and demonstrate the use of a Spring Boot server app with an Angular client side UI. Currently it can be used to aggregate images from webcams that expose images through http endpoints and also supports basic auth. It uses Spring Boot as the application server to provide REST endpoints to the client side Angular UI. Spring security is used to secure the endpoints and handle user authn/authz.</description>

      <description>We used xor to keep your secrets safe If you experience this situation it is time to look closer. While XOR will make a string that is eyeball safe it isn&amp;rsquo;t going to provide protection from even the casually interested. Weather this was chosen by the developers due to timeline pressures and added to the fix it later list or just an unfortunate set of google results you need to understand why simple XOR isn&amp;rsquo;t an option for security.</description>
